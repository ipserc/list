# list
Doubly linked list library

A list is a structure of chained (linked) nodes that can be specified by its head node (and optionally with its tail node too).
Between these two nodes is the complete list and the link between the nodes allows you to traverse it in an orderly manner, to recover each of its elements. The operations necessary to manage lists include the creation and destruction of the list. the remaining operations are operations that involve the nodes as they are. the appendix, the drop, the elimination and the insertion of nodes. 

A node is the unit with which the linked lists are mounted. 
Each node has a reference to its predecessor and its successor. 
The head and tail nodes are special because their predecessor and successor are set to NULL respectively. 
A node also has a void pointer that serves to point to the information structure it transports so that the list of nodes can organize the information.
