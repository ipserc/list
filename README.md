A list is a structure of chained (linked) nodes that can be specified by its head node (and optionally with its tail node too). 
Between these two nodes is the complete list and the link between the nodes allows you to traverse it in an orderly manner, to recover each of its elements. 
The operations necessary to manage lists include the creation and destruction of the list. the remaining operations are operations that involve the nodes as they are. the appendix, the drop, the elimination and the insertion of nodes.
